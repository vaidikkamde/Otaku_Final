      "Otaku is really a good organization I really liked it and I think it needs more popularity and more support because the more you become famous the more you will be recognized by others and people will come forward to help you .my support will always remain for otaku and the thing I liked the most in this organization is helping the poor . I hope otaku will be in a great position in future",
